# About
I am a computational biologist with over seven years of experience in bioinformatics, data science, genomics, and molecular biology. Equally well-versed in academic research, I leverage a unique interdisciplinary background in neuroscience, immunology, and bioinformatics to create data-driven solutions that transform scientific results into clinical practices and targeted therapies. Currently, I am a postdoc at HZI, spearheading the development of multi-scale generative and inference models to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying viral, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases.{: style="text-align: justify"}
I received my PhD in neuroimmunology from MHH, working in Ulrich Kalinke's lab at Twincore. My doctoral research focused on deciphering the brainâ€™s antiviral responses in virus-induced encephalitis. I developed novel experimental and computational tools for in-situ transcriptomics and investigated the brain cellular interactome following pathological insults. During my time there, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of immunologists, neurologists, and pharmaceutical experts to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation.{: style="text-align: justify"}
Beyond my technical skills, I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a strong work ethic and a collaborative spirit. I thrive in dynamic, interdisciplinary environments and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow.{: style="text-align: justify"}
