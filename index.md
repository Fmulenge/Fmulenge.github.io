# Bio
I am a computational biologist with over seven years of experience in bioinformatics, data science, genomics, and molecular biology. Equally well-versed in academic research, I leverage a unique interdisciplinary background in neuroscience, immunology, and bioinformatics to create data-driven solutions that transform scientific results into clinical practices and targeted therapies. Currently, I am a postdoc at [HZI](https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/), spearheading the development of multi-scale generative and inference models to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying viral, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases. <br>
I received my PhD in neuroimmunology from [MHH](https://www.mhh.de/en/), working in Ulrich Kalinke's lab at [Twincore](https://www.twincore.de/en/home/). My doctoral research focused on deciphering the brainâ€™s antiviral responses in virus-induced encephalitis. I developed novel experimental and computational tools for in-situ transcriptomics and investigated the brain cellular interactome following pathological insults. During my time there, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of immunologists([Ghita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-ghita-990a77a4/),[Pavlou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-pavlou-3470b5124/),[Duran](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/veronica-duran)), neurologists([],[]), and pharmaceutical experts to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation. <br>
Beyond my technical skills, I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a strong work ethic and a collaborative spirit. I thrive in dynamic, interdisciplinary environments and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow.
